# fitTrack — Starter

A minimal starter React + TypeScript project scaffolded with Vite, React Router, and MUI (Material UI).

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\personalProjects\fitTrack
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Notes:
- Uses `vite` for development server and build.
- `@mui/material` + `@emotion/*` for styling and theme.
- `react-router-dom` v6 for routing.

Next steps:
- Add pages and routes as needed.
- Add state management or API integration.
